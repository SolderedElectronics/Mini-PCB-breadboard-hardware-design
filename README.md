A 2-in-1 breadboard and PCB is what you get when combining the simplicity of the one and functionality of the other. It is the same size as the modular mini breadboard and has the same connections to pins. This PCB lets you move your circuit from a temporary connection on a classic breadboard to a more permanent place by soldering all the pieces.
